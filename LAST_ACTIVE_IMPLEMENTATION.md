# Last Active Feature Implementation Summary

## Overview
Implemented a comprehensive "Last Active" tracking system for the USS Serenity roster that shows when each character was last active, supporting multiple characters per user.

## Database Changes
- Added `last_active` TIMESTAMP field to the `roster` table
- Field allows NULL values for characters that have never been active

## Core Functionality

### 1. Last Active Tracking (`includes/config.php`)
- **`updateLastActive()`** function updates the current character's `last_active` timestamp
- Called automatically on major page loads to track user activity
- Silently fails if there are any errors to avoid breaking pages

### 2. Character Switching (`includes/config.php`)
- Updated `switchCharacter()` function to:
  - Set `character_id` in session for tracking
  - Update `last_active` timestamp when switching characters
- Each character maintains its own independent activity timestamp

### 3. Steam Authentication (`steamauth/steamauth.php`)
- Added `character_id` to session variables during login
- Updates `last_active` timestamp when users first log in
- Ensures proper tracking from the moment of authentication

### 4. Character Creation (`pages/create_character.php`)
- Sets initial `last_active` timestamp for new characters
- Adds `character_id` to session when first character is created
- Ensures new characters are immediately tracked

## Display Implementation (`pages/roster.php`)

### Visual Indicators
The roster now displays last active status with color-coded indicators:

- **ðŸŸ¢ Online** (Green): Active within last 5 minutes
- **ðŸŸ¡ Recent** (Gold/Orange): Hours ago or 1-6 days ago  
- **ðŸ”´ Inactive** (Red): More than a week ago
- **âš« Never** (Gray): Never logged in

### Time Display Format
- **< 5 minutes**: "Online"
- **Same day**: "Xh Ym ago" 
- **1 day**: "1 day ago"
- **2-6 days**: "X days ago"
- **> 1 week**: "Mon DD, YYYY" (date format)
- **Never**: "Never logged in"

### Styling
- LCARS-themed styling with dark background
- Color-coded status indicators
- Compact display that doesn't interfere with existing card layout

## Multi-Character Support

### Per-Character Tracking
- Each character has its own `last_active` timestamp
- When users switch characters, only the active character's timestamp updates
- Inactive characters retain their last known activity time
- Supports up to 5 characters per user

### User Experience
- Users can see when each crew member was last active
- Distinguishes between characters controlled by the same user
- Provides immediate feedback on crew activity levels

## Pages Updated with Tracking

The following pages now automatically update last active timestamps:

1. **index.php** - Main homepage
2. **pages/roster.php** - Crew roster (main implementation)
3. **pages/profile.php** - User profile
4. **pages/command.php** - Command department
5. **pages/eng_ops.php** - Engineering/Operations
6. **pages/med_sci.php** - Medical/Science
7. **pages/sec_tac.php** - Security/Tactical
8. **pages/cargo_bay.php** - Cargo bay management
9. **pages/create_character.php** - Character creation

## Technical Features

### Performance Optimizations
- Uses efficient SQL UPDATE queries
- Silent error handling prevents page breaks
- Minimal overhead on page loads

### Data Integrity
- NULL handling for characters that have never been active
- Proper foreign key relationships maintained
- No impact on existing roster functionality

### Security
- All user input properly sanitized
- Database queries use prepared statements
- Session-based character tracking prevents unauthorized access

## Testing Features

Created several testing utilities:
- `test_last_active.php` - Sets sample timestamps for testing
- `test_roster_status.php` - Shows current status overview
- `setup_multichar_test.php` - Creates multi-character test scenarios

## Usage Instructions

### For Administrators
1. Run `add_last_active_field.php` to add the database field (if not already done)
2. Use testing scripts to verify functionality
3. Monitor roster page for proper display

### For Users
- Last active status appears automatically on roster cards
- No action required - timestamps update automatically when using the site
- Each character maintains independent activity tracking

## Future Enhancements

Potential improvements that could be added:
1. Admin dashboard showing activity statistics
2. Configurable "online" time threshold
3. Activity history logging
4. Department-specific activity reports
5. Automatic character switching based on activity

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues
1. **Missing timestamps**: Ensure `add_last_active_field.php` was run
2. **Not updating**: Check that `updateLastActive()` calls are present in page headers
3. **Wrong character tracking**: Verify `character_id` is properly set in session

### Database Verification
```sql
-- Check if last_active field exists
DESCRIBE roster;

-- View current activity status
SELECT id, first_name, last_name, last_active 
FROM roster 
ORDER BY last_active DESC;
```

This implementation provides a comprehensive activity tracking system that enhances the USS Serenity crew management experience while maintaining full compatibility with the existing LCARS-themed interface.
