- ✅ Token validation before sensitive operations
- ✅ Session-based token storage

**Files with CSRF Protection:**
- `pages/data_rights.php` - Account deletion and data export

- ✅ Role-based permissions (Admin, Department Heads)

### 6. **File Upload Security** ✅
- ✅ File type validation (MIME and extension checking)
- ✅ File size limits (5MB default)
- ✅ Secure filename generation using `bin2hex(random_bytes())`
- ✅ Upload directory outside web root option
- ✅ Image validation using `getimagesize()`
- ✅ Allowed file types whitelist

**Secure upload function:** `secureFileUpload()` in `secure_config.php`

### 7. **HTTP Security Headers** ✅
Implemented in `includes/security_headers.php` and `.htaccess`:

- ✅ `X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff` - Prevents MIME sniffing
- ✅ `X-Frame-Options: DENY` - Prevents clickjacking
- ✅ `X-XSS-Protection: 1; mode=block` - Browser XSS protection
- ✅ `Referrer-Policy: strict-origin-when-cross-origin` - Referrer control
- ✅ `Content-Security-Policy` - Restricts resource loading
- ✅ Server signature removal (`X-Powered-By`)

### 8. **Access Control (.htaccess)** ✅
- ✅ Directory browsing disabled (`Options -Indexes`)
- ✅ Sensitive file types blocked (.env, .md, .log, .sql, .conf, etc.)
- ✅ Configuration files protected
- ✅ Hidden files and directories blocked
- ✅ Includes directory access restricted
- ✅ SQL injection patterns blocked in URLs
- ✅ PHP execution disabled in upload directories

### 9. **Input Validation & Sanitization** ✅
Helper functions in `secure_config.php`:
- ✅ `sanitizeInput()` - Type-aware input cleaning
- ✅ `escapeOutput()` - HTML entity encoding
- ✅ Filter functions for email, int, float, URL validation
- ✅ Input validation before database operations

### 10. **Database Security** ✅
- ✅ Credentials in environment variables (`.env` file)
- ✅ Database user with minimal privileges (recommended)
- ✅ No database credentials in version control
- ✅ PDO with exception mode enabled
- ✅ Prepared statements for all queries

### 11. **Error Handling** ✅
- ✅ Display errors disabled in production
- ✅ Error logging to files (not displayed to users)
- ✅ Custom error pages (recommended)
- ✅ Graceful error handling in security headers

### 12. **GDPR Compliance** ✅
- ✅ User data export functionality
- ✅ Account deletion with data purging
- ✅ Privacy policy page
- ✅ Terms of service page
- ✅ Data rights management page
- ✅ Consent tracking
- ✅ Data retention policies
- ✅ Automated cleanup script (`gdpr_cleanup.php`)

### 13. **Rate Limiting & DoS Protection** ⚠️
- ⚠️ Request timeout configured in `.htaccess`
- ⚠️ Manual implementation recommended for login attempts
- 💡 **Recommendation:** Implement login attempt throttling

### 14. **Secure Configuration Management** ✅
- ✅ Environment variables for sensitive data
- ✅ `.env.example` template provided
- ✅ Default credentials flagged for change
- ✅ Configuration files protected from web access

## 🔒 Production Deployment Checklist

Before deploying to production, ensure:

### Environment Configuration
- [ ] Change all default passwords in `.env` file
- [ ] Set strong database password
- [ ] Update Steam API key with production key
- [ ] Update domain name to production domain
- [ ] Set `display_errors = Off` in php.ini
- [ ] Set `log_errors = On` in php.ini
- [ ] Configure error log path

### HTTPS/SSL
- [ ] Install valid SSL certificate
- [ ] Force HTTPS redirect
- [ ] Uncomment HSTS header in `.htaccess` (after SSL is verified)
- [ ] Update Steam API settings to use HTTPS callback

### Database Security
- [ ] Create dedicated database user with minimal privileges
- [ ] Use strong database password
- [ ] Restrict database access to localhost only
- [ ] Enable MySQL SSL connections if available
- [ ] Regular database backups configured

### File Permissions
- [ ] Set proper file permissions (644 for files, 755 for directories)
- [ ] Ensure `.env` is not readable by web server
- [ ] Upload directory has write permissions
- [ ] Includes directory not publicly accessible

### Monitoring & Logging
- [ ] Set up error log monitoring
- [ ] Configure server access logs
- [ ] Set up intrusion detection (fail2ban recommended)
- [ ] Enable MySQL slow query logging
- [ ] Set up uptime monitoring

### Regular Maintenance
- [ ] Keep PHP updated to latest stable version
- [ ] Update dependencies regularly
- [ ] Review security logs weekly
- [ ] Test backup restoration monthly
- [ ] Update CSP policy as needed
- [ ] Run GDPR cleanup cron job daily
